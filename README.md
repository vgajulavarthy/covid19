you can download the protine

Inter organic chemisty 
I got time for explaining entire organic chemistry but I wish not to do that here, it is redundant and not nessaray.
people who can understand the basic chemistry and coding are ideal to go through this ordeal, if you are either one of them please suggest things in your domain. if you are nither of them sit and enjoy.

Things you must go through before you can get the hang of the project.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid
you got to know what a amino acid is

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_and_beta_carbon
you must know what are the aplha and beta carbons

https://www.britannica.com/science/genetic-code
you got to know about the genitic code you are working on.

this is the GK of our project 

after that you got to know statics to assess the genome, and identify the given protiens 

now programmer section:

we need to develop a string operation library to assess the genome. (genome is a huge string) or we must use any open source libries
